                    <p> Historically rich Lower Manhattan has a very extensive subterranean network that includes

                    extensive pedestrian passageways that almost stretches from the East River 
                    waterfront, at Fulton and Williams Street; to the Hudson River waterfront. 
                    Lower Manhattan now has a 21st. century state of the art subterranean that 
                    links two major transportation hubs, two major shopping centers and stretches 
                    all the way to the Freedom Tower and through to the Hudson River waterfront.

                    <p> Before heading down to the subterranean levels, it is worth noting that
                    the heart of Lower Manhattan has now been solidified as a dining destination
                    with Chef Nobuyuki Matsuhisa's

                    The newly opened restaurant is in the landmarked former AT&T headquarters; 
                    on the block between Fulton Center and the 9/11 Memorial and Museum. The visually stunning
                    modernity decor that merges two unique cultures with the building's stately columns
                    makes the sets of Mad Men looks like a playhouses.

                    <p> The <a href="http://www.fultoncenternyc.com">Fulton Center</a> is a major 
                    transit hub and retail complex at the intersection of Broadway and Fulton Street. 
                    It is a glass and steel structure that has a very science fiction design, resembling the 
                    interior of a movie spaceship with huge screens of flashing advertisements. The 
                    retailers here mostly cater to commuters with a New York's favorite, 
                    <a href="https://www.shakeshack.com">Shake Shake</a> as the anchor tenant.
                    Reference the first image to the left for all the subway lines at this station.

                    <p>The circular designs leading to the subway entrances and platforms bear
                    similarites to a coliseum. It is the starting point of the state-of-the-art
                    subterranean section of Lower Manhattan.

                         cathedral, part futuristic movie set, (part my home... oh! no, I was daydreaming for a moment),
                         with the atmospherics of a large stadium. The opennes of the concourse 
                         allows one to walk, stride, glide, stroll and marvel freely. The ribbed structured 
                         glass ceiling brings sunlight into the subterranean levels and also allows segmented views 
                         to the sky and buildings around. The exterior of the Oculus bears features of "a bird released from hand."

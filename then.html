                <p> This was the World Trade Center most New Yorkers once knew. The famous Twin Towers
                was destroyed in the deadliest terrorism attack on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks">September 11, 2001</a>; 
                a horror that not only shocked New York but the world. 2606 lives perished along with 
                the towers, several thousands were injured and the entire area was utterly destroyed 
                and then in desolation for the next five years.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> In 2006, after the control over the redevelopment of the area were handed to the 
                Port Authority, the construction of the new World Trade Center, the memorial and museum began.

                    <br>
                    <p>This was how the lower level shopping concourse looked at The Mall at World Trade Center.
                Though it had high traffic, it was not exactly a destination 
                shopping center for most. The retail establishments mostly cater to the commuters, offices 
                workforce and tourists.
                    </p>
                    <p>The level below ground was basically intact and suffered minimal damage even with 
                the weight of the collapsed towers on it. 
                    </p>
                    <p>With the rise of the new World Trade Center, a new shopping center emerge. 
                Hover over the above image to glimpse the new spectacularly transformed location.
                The name is Westfield World Trade Center.

                    <h3>Outdoor Plaza</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>This was the scene at the plaza outside the Twin Towers, a very spacious public plaza,
                    where the tourists marveled at the towers and the offices workforce enjoyed their 
                    lunches on a beautiful day. After office hours, the area quickly quiet down, leaving 
                    perhaps small groups of tourists and a few couples out on a date after work.
                    </p>
                    <p>The collapsed of the Twin Towers destroyed the plaza, covering it with concrete, steel,
                    debris and ash in the months after. Law enforcement officers, firemen and recovery personnel 
                    continued their duties over and amid it.

                    <p>It is now the site of the <a href="https://www.911memorial.org"> 9/11 Memorial and Museum.</a>

                    <br>
                    <p>These two intersections had a view of the entrance to The Mall at the 
                    World Trade Center. From Mondays to Fridays, this location was very busy with 
                    high vehicular, pedestrian and commuter traffic. On weekends, it had much lower traffic, 
                    mostly tourists and some local shoppers.
                    </p>
                    <p>This location is now spectacularly transformed with the rise of the Oculus,
                    with its east entrances to Westfield and onwards to the Path Station.

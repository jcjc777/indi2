                <p> The spirit and resilience of New York were tested. From the ashes of 
                original World Trade Center rose the patriotic 1776 feet Freedom Tower. 
                The architect was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Childs">David Childs,</a> 
                of the architectural firm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skidmore,_Owings_%26_Merrill">Skidmore, Owings & Merrill.</a>
                </p>
                <p> It is now officially known as <a href="https://www.wtc.com/about/buildings/1-world-trade-center">One World Trade Center,</a> currently
                the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere, and the sixth-tallest in the world.
                </p>
                <p> On the 100th. floor at the One World Observatory, one can explore the expansive 
                360 degree panoramic view of New York City and points beyond.

                    <p> On September 11, 2011, a dedication ceremony commemorating the

                    to the public the following day. The museum was dedicated on May 15, 2014
                    and opened on May 21. Three months after its opening, the memorial 
                    had been visited by over a million people.
                    </p>

                    <p> The supertall structure has the same name as the North Tower

                   rebuilt World Trade Center complex, standing on the northwest corner,
                   bounded by West Street to the west, Vesey Street to the north, 
                   Fulton Street to the south, and Washington Street to the east.

                    <p>Together with the many new luxury residential towers and highrises
                    as a result of the current real-estate boom, this new skyscraper has 
                    greatly and significantly changed the skyline of not only Lower
                    Manhattan but New York as well.
